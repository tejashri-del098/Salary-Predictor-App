## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìä Interactive Prediction Interface:** Engage with a clean and intuitive Streamlit UI to input data and get instant salary predictions.
*   **üß† Machine Learning Powered:** Leverages a pre-trained model (`model3.pkl`) for accurate and data-driven salary estimations.
*   **üöÄ Easy Deployment:** Set up and run the application locally with minimal configuration, thanks to `requirements.txt` and `app.py`.
*   **üìà Model Insights:** Explore the `ALgo.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to understand the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.
*   **üì¶ Organized Project Structure:** A well-defined repository including datasets, model artifacts, and application code for clarity.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the Salary Predictor App up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Step-by-step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tejashri-del098/Salary-Predictor-App.git
    cd Salary-Predictor-App
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once the installation is complete, you can run the Streamlit application to start predicting salaries.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Streamlit App:**
    With your virtual environment activated, execute the `app.py` file using Streamlit:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This command will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

2.  **Interact with the Predictor:**
    *   Use the interactive fields in the web interface to input relevant data (e.g., years of experience, education level, job role).
    *   Click the "Predict Salary" button to see the estimated salary generated by the model.

### Exploring the Model Training

If you're interested in the underlying machine learning model and data analysis:

1.  **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
    Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Access `ALgo.ipynb`:**
    Open the `ALgo.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface to review the data loading, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation steps.


## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

We have several exciting features and improvements planned for the Salary Predictor App:

*   **Version 1.1.0 - Enhanced Model & UI Refinement:**
    *   Integrate additional machine learning models for comparison and ensemble predictions.
    *   Improve UI/UX with more visual feedback and responsive design elements.
    *   Add a feature to upload custom datasets for model retraining (local only).
*   **Version 1.2.0 - Data Visualization & Insights:**
    *   Implement interactive charts within the app to visualize salary trends and feature importance.
    *   Provide insights into the factors influencing the predicted salary.
*   **Future - Deployment & Scalability:**
    *   Explore options for deploying the application to cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure).
    *   Implement user authentication and save prediction history (if applicable).
